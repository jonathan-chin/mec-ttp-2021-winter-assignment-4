# MEC TTP 2021 Winter Assignment 4: Connect 4

## Purpose

To practice combining all the elements we've learned from previous classes (HTML, CSS, and JS) within the framing of building a web based Connect 4 game.

## Background

Connect 4 is a relatively simple game, played on a 6x7 grid. Players take turn selecting a column and placing a marker of their own at the lowest empty cell in that column. Players win by having 4 of their markers in a row (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) anywhere on the board. You can read more about the rules and history here:

## Task

You are going to build an interactive, responsive web application that plays a game of Connect 4 against an AI. At the very least, your game must:

- Allow the user to place their markers by click on the page
- Have a simple AI that automatically plays after the user
- End the game as soon as 4 markers are in a row
- Determine when a tie should happen
- Allow the user to play multiple games without reloading the page
- Track a user's wins, losses, and ties across multiple games
- Look good both on a laptop and smartphone
- Use Materialize's grid system


## Requirements

You can include as many external CSS and JS files as you need. However, you must include an `index.html` file. This is what we'll run first to determine your grade. If needed, we will also look at your other individual CSS and JS files.

## Reduce the Problem Space

Remember to simplify the game enough so that it's achievable within the timeframe you have. **So long as you explicitly list your assumptions, it's OK to reduce the complexity of your program.* For example, you can `assume the AI will just pick a move at random`.

The point of this assignment is to get you to use HTML, CSS, and JS in a comprehensive, coordinated way, not to see if you can write an Connect 4 AI. Don't spend too much time on the skills we're not targeting. Of course, if you finish early, you can go back and polish up the parts you glanced over.

## Reference Materials

You can use the boilerplate index.html file in this repo as a starting point.
